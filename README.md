# PythonExercises

This is a repo that I created to practice version control with Git and GitHub early on as I began to study code. As part of my graduation requirements from
the Coding Temple bootcamp, this repository also serves to store the solutions for all of solved problems on Codewars.com

In addition to storing Code Wars solutions, this repository has served as practiced for making new branches in git repositories.
